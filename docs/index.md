# Osprey Knockout - Fun photograhic competition

A head-head photographic competition - a different yet fun competition to get the whole club involved.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This is a piece of software that I wrote for Bishop's Waltham Photographic Society many years ago. We wanted something light hearted to do post AGM.  We hold our AGMs in January, so often images have a Christmas-slant.  But it could be used any time of the year; generally we've found it to be best done in a 'light-hearted' manner.

Starting from a pool of images; two images are picked at random.  All the members vote on their favourite image from the two. The one with the fewest votes being eliminated. Much like like in sporting events, there are rounds so the number of images halves every time.

So starting from say 16 images in the first round, then 8 in the quarter-finals, 4 in the semi-finals, to the final 2 you get to semi-finals, then the final. 

It's proved very enteraining evening and we continue to use it.

Though we've been using this for some years; it hasn't really been used in other clubs. Please be gentle - and please do get in touch.  I'd love other clubs to have the same fun interactive evenings we've had... so please do get in touch if you want to try this out. We can walk through it over Zoom for example.
