# Install the software

Currently this is only available for Windows - primarily as I don't have access to a Mac! 

The latest release (v0.2) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/osprey-photo/osprey-knockout/releases/download/v0.2/Osprey.Knockout-0.2.msi).  

This is a standard windows installer, so install like anything else. *However* Windows will tell you it can't verify the origin of the program. You would need to accept and 'install anyway'.

MS require that the programs be electronically signed; that's good - but for software that is free I can't justify the several hundred Â£ that would be needed to get this properly signed. 

There should be now be icon for Osprey Knockout either on your backdrop or in the start menu. 

Double click on this and the competition software will start.
